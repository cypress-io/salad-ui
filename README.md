# SaladUI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cypress-io/salad-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cypress-io/salad-ui)

SaladUI provides a collection of simple React Components to build Universal apps.

### Usage

You can either include all the components:

```
npm i --save salad-ui
```

```js
import Salad from 'salad-ui'
class myComponent extends React.Component{
  render(){
     return <Salad.Form.Autocomplete/>
  }
}
```

Or some of the elements separately (lightweight!)

```bash
npm i --save salad-ui.form
```

```js
import { Autocomplete } from 'salad-ui.form'
class myComponent extends React.Component{
  render(){
     return <Autocomplete/>
  }
}
```
